? should use texture atlas immediately?
the json output of TILED lists just NUMBERS.
using ASCII should work ok as well.

use spritesheetpacker 
http://spritesheetpacker.codeplex.com/

level design in ascii,

the output of spritesheetpacker is:
grass = 0 0 32 32
trees = 33 0 32 32
object = x y w h

I ran into the problem of the rectangles below you pushing you right and left.

Fixed the collision detection to use B, L, R, T tile checks (in order)

	- After checking the top you also check the bottom, to ensure stability

Next would be Animation.
